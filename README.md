# Expense Tracker

Learn how to create an expense tracker app and understand PDAs

## About

PDAs are a very powerful block of Solana. We're going to create a simple expense tracking app that allows us to add,
update and remove expense entries. This tutorial is based
on [Expense Tracker Workshop](https://github.com/GitBolt/expense-tracker-workshop). You can find full client side
code there with table and chart as well.
